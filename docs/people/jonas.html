<span id="jonas"></span><h1>Jonas Kahnwald<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-kahnwald" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Jonas is the son of <a class="reference internal" href="hannah.html#hannah"><span class="std std-ref">Hannah Kahnwald</span></a> and Mikkel Nielsen, and the father
of the nameless man.  He is the best candidate to any sort of
protagonist of <em>Dark</em>.  He begins his life in the 2000s, being led to
discover time travel after the suicide of his father.  After the
apocalypse of world A in 2020, his chronology splits into three
different lines.</p>
<p>Jonas-C survives the apocalypse and grows to a middle-aged man in
post-apocalyptic Winden, trying to get time travel to work in the
destroyed nuclear plant, although the efforts are secretly sabotaged
by Claudia.  Upon finally returning to Winden he attempts to close the
passage.  Experiencing the apocalypse again, he escapes back to the
1890s together with a cadre of characters, where he begins forming the
nascent Sic Mundus and takes on the persona of Adam, aiming to end the
cycle by destroying the unborn nameless man.</p>
<p>Jonas-D is rescued by Martha-B and taken to world B, where he sets
into motion the necessary events to perpetuate the cycle there.  In
particular he sleeps with Martha, bringing the nameless man into
existence.  He is shot dead shortly thereafter by Martha.</p>
<p>Jonas-E is rescued by Adam and taken to world B where he intercepts
the timeline of Martha, taking her to world Z where they together
successfully end the cycle.</p>
<div class="section" id="jonas-a">
<span id="jonasa"></span><h2>Jonas-A<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-a" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The chronology of Jonas-A constitues everything that happens from the
day before his fathers suicide in June of 2019, until the apocalypse
of world A in the summer of 2020.</p>
<div class="section" id="jonas-1">
<h3>Jonas-1<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On June 20, 2019, exactly one day before the opening of the passage,
Jonas is enjoying a nice day at the like together with Martha-1,
Magnus-1 and Bartosz-1.  Bartosz tells a story of a woman who drowned
in the lake.  In fact, unbeknownst to anyone, the dead body of
Katharina is actually there.  In the sand, Jonas finds a
St. Christopher medal, where it was left after the scuffle between
Helene and Katharina.  Jonas must leave early, and he leaves the medal
behind.</p>
<p>Later that day, at Katharina’s birthday party, Jonas runs into Martha
who gives him the St. Christopher medal, now on a chain.  Martha is
acting very forward, because since the last time they met she ran into
Jonas-7, believing him to be Jonas-1.  They eventually kiss and sleep
together.</p>
<p>The next day, Jonas and his mother discover the suicide of Michael,
along with a suicide note which eventually passes to Ines, Jonas’
grandmother by adoption.  Over time, the relationship between Hannah
and Ines start deteriorating.  Jonas finds himself needing to take
time off school for therapy.  Preventing his father’s death is Jonas’
principal motivation for the first part of the story.</p>
<p>On November 4, his first day back in school, he goes to the caves
together with Martha, Magnus, Bartosz and Mikkel-1.  They are
looking for Erik’s secret stash of drugs.  After this, Mikkel goes
missing, having been taken by Jonas-7 through the tunnel
to 1986.</p>
<p>The next day, Jonas discovers a map of the Winden caves hidden in his
late father’s studio.  On November 6 he enters the cave to explore,
but is unable to find the way.  That night, middle-aged Jonas-10C
sneaks into his bedroom to scribble a hint on the map.  The next day
he also meets Jonas-10C at the graveyard, not knowing who he is.  The
elder Jonas says they don’t know each other, but that Jonas’ father
once saved his life (which he did, by committing suicide).</p>
<p>Later that day, Jonas breaks a promise to Bartosz and instead of
joining him goes to see Martha’s theater practice.  He reveals to her
the fact about his absence from school, and they kiss again.  When he
comes home, he finds a package sent to him by Jonas-10C with cave
exploration equipment and his father’s opened suicide note.  He reads
the note, which is addressed to him. On November 8, armed with better
tools and knowledge, he re-enters the cave and successfully finds the
tunnel, traveling to 1986 as Jonas-2.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-2">
<h3>Jonas-2<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Jonas meets Hannah-1, his own mother as a young girl and spends the
night in a watchtower.  The next day, Egon gives him a lift to the
hospital, where he intends to retrieve Mikkel-2, however Jonas-11C
(the same Jonas he met earlier in the graveyard), having traveled to
1986 the day before Jonas-2 did, intercepts him and explains that
Mikkel must stay here in order for Jonas to exist at all.  Later that
day, he travels back to 2019 as Jonas-3.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-3">
<h3>Jonas-3<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Upon coming home, Jonas burns the suicide note from his father that
the elder Jonas had given him.  A few days later he rejects Martha’s
advances, knowing full well that she is his own aunt.  Martha, of
course, is confused because she received very strong hints from
Jonas-7, which the younger Jonas is unaware of.</p>
<p>On November 12, Jonas goes to Ines, and she tells him that she knew
that Mikkel-2 came from the future.  She gives him the suicide note.
This time Jonas does not destroy it.  He will carry it with him for
decades in post-apocalyptic Winden before giving it to his younger
self.  Later that day, he again travels through the tunnel to 1986,
becoming Jonas-4.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-4">
<h3>Jonas-4<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After a brief and cryptic conversation with young Charlotte-2, Jonas
makes his way to Mikkel-2’s bed in the hospital, but is abducted by
Noah and Helge-3.  They take him to the bunker, where the elder
Jonas-13C explains who he really is, and why he cannot let the younger
Jonas out.</p>
<p>When Jonas-13C later closes the tunnel using the machine, a wormhole
appears in the bunker, allowing Helge-1 to travel from 1953 to 1986,
and for Jonas to travel to 2052 as Jonas-5.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-5">
<h3>Jonas-5<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Upon arrival in postapocalyptic Winden, he is promptly arrested by
Silja-3, Elisabeth-1 and their paramilitary group.  Over the next
months, he takes to live in his old home, the Kahnwald house, where he
notes the presence of a St. Christopher medal exactly like he has.</p>
<p>Most of his time is spent listening to the old audio tapes left behind
by the elder Claudia, who spent many years doing research in the
bunker.  Silja and Elisabeth want to prevent him from accessing the
old power plant ruins, but eventually Jonas sneaks in anyway and finds
a mass of God particles there.</p>
<p>On an excursion to get fuel for a generator, he is arrested and hanged
by Elisabeth, but is also saved by at the last minute.  This gives him
a bad and very visible scar around his neck.</p>
<p>Later on, Silja lets him go free.  He takes her to the God particle
mas and uses it to travel from 2053 to 1921, becoming Jonas-6.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-6">
<h3>Jonas-6<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Jonas arrives in 1921 on June 24.  At the inn, he meets the young
siblings Agnes-1 and Noah-1.  Attempting to enter the tunnel, Jonas
finds it closed, and Noah explains that it will not open for another
32 years (on June 21, 1953).  He is then taken to the Sic Mundus
headquarters, meeting again the elder Noah who abducted him earlier.</p>
<p>Adam then sends Jonas to June 20, 2019, the same day the slightly
younger Jonas-1 spent at the lake.  This is the first time we see a
time travel interval that is not a multiple of 33 years.  Young Jonas
believes he can prevent his father’s suicide, and Adam is all too
happy to let him believe it, knowing instead that he will cause in the
first place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-7">
<h3>Jonas-7<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Jonas goes to the lake to talk to Martha, just after his younger self
Jonas-1 left.  This time he acts very romantically, saying
they are indeed perfect for each other (he must have regretted the
earlier confrontation) and they kiss.</p>
<p>Later that day, he makes his way to the Kahnwald house while everyone
else is at Katharina’s birthday party.  He tries to convince his
father not to commit suicide, but all he really does is ensure that it
happens.  He even shows him the suicide note, allowing his father to
read what it is he must write.</p>
<p>The elderly Claudia appears and reveals Adam’s betrayal, and explains
that, nevertheless, the older Mikkel-2 must die, and Jonas-7 must also
engineer the disappearance of younger Mikkel-2 several months later.</p>
<p>We next see Jonas in 1987 as Jonas-8, acting as the agent of elderly
Claudia.  Between now and then he has spent about a full year of
personal time under her tutalage.  It seems that, during this time,
his motivation is transfered from his father to saving Martha from the
impending apocalypse.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-8">
<h3>Jonas-8<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On June 26, 1987, Jonas finds middle-aged Claudia-3 devastated in her
own kitchen after the death of her father Egon.  He has been tasked by
the elderly Claudia to influence her, indicating that Egon’s death may
be prevented.</p>
<p>They go to the caves, where Jonas collects God particle from the
barrels and activates the machine (which he got from Claudia),
reopening the tunnel in the process.  They both travel to 2020.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-9">
<h3>Jonas-9<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On the day of the apocalypse in world A, Jonas-9 and Claudia-4 arrive.
Jonas instructs Claudia to find Regina and take shelter in the bunker.
Jonas himself makes his way to the Kahnwald house, where he finds
Martha-3.  There, they are interrupted by the arrival of Adam, who
shoots and kills Martha.</p>
<p>At this point, the apocalypse happens, allowing a splitting of Jonas’
timeline.  It’s important to note that none of the three versions of
Jonas are aware of the others.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In one case, Jonas simply makes his way to the basement of the house
and survives the apocalypse.  He lives out the rest of his youth and
early adulthood in postapocalyptic Winden as Jonas-9C.  This is the
Jonas that eventually becomes Adam.  At this point his motivation is
primarily driven by trying to prevent Martha’s death at the hands of
his elderly self.</p></li>
<li><p>In another case, Jonas is rescued by Martha from world B and taken
there, becoming Jonas-9D.  He is responsible for key events in the
perpetuation of the cycle in that world, but does not live long.</p></li>
<li><p>In the third case, Jonas is rescued by <em>another</em> version of Adam,
taken to the apocalypse of world B as Jonas-9E where he teams up
with a version of Martha.  The two then finally end the cycle.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-c">
<span id="jonasc"></span><h2>Jonas-C<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this timeline, Jonas simply makes his way to the basemewnt of the
house and manages to survive the apocalypse.  He lives on the rest of
his youth and early adulthood in post-apocalyptic Winden as Jonas-9C.
This is the Jonas that eventually becomes Adam.  At this point his
actions are primarily driven by trying to prevent Martha’s death at
the hands of his elderly self.</p>
<div class="section" id="jonas-9c">
<h3>Jonas-9C<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-9c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On September 24, 2020, Jonas-9C runs into Claudia-4 again, this time
by the God particle mass in the power plant.  It’s revealed that the
machine that brought them there from the 80s was broken in the
apocalypse.</p>
<p>The next time we see Jonas, in 2023, he is working together with
Claudia to try to get the God particle mass to function correctly.
Some kind of shield appears to be preventing their work.  Jonas loses
heart and goes to the Kahnwald house to commit suicide in the same
place where his father once did.  He is interrupted by Noah-2, who
demonstrates to Jonas how truly futile it is to try to change events.
Noah appears to be of the opinion that they will be friends before
Jonas will betray him.  (Although it is really the elderly Adam who
will be perpetrating the betrayal.)</p>
<p>The group of four then forms: Jonas, Noah, Elisabeth and Claudia.  For
the next decades, they continue experimenting with the God particle
without success.  A breakthrough does not happen until 2040, when they
succeed in penetrating the shield, however time travel is still far
from possible. Noah harbors misgivings about Claudia’s true
motivations (which is correct, Claudia is sabotaging the experiments),
and he abandons the work in 2041 after his daughter is abducted,
believing this to be Jonas’ betrayal.</p>
<p>In 2052, having finally stabilized the God particle, Claudia sends
Jonas back to 2019.  He brings with him the broken time machine,
intending for Tannhaus to repair it, and the book about time travel.
His instructions are to close the tunnel and destroy the knot, and she
implores him not to lose hope (although he will).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-10c">
<h3>Jonas-10C<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-10c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Jonas arrives in 2019 on November 5, and takes a room at the hotel
where he decorates the walls with time travel effects.  His first acts
are to help his younger self explore the cave, by writing a hint on
his map and later sending him a box of cave exploration equipment.
This is also when he gives away his father’s suicide note for the last
time.  Younger Jonas will burn it.</p>
<p>After the conversation at the graveyard with Jonas-1, he goes through
the tunnel to 1986, becoming Jonas-11C.</p>

<p>On November 7, Jonas first meets the elder Tannhaus.  He spends
several days in 1986, meeting Tannhaus on and off.  He eventually
shows him the broken time machine, and although the master is at first
reluctant to help, he shows him the new machine that he has been
working on.</p>

the younger Jonas-4 who is now trapped there.  He leaves him behind,
knowing that a wormhole will soon let him travel to 2052.</p>
<p>When he activates the machine in the tunnel, he also travels back to
2019 in the process, becoming Jonas-14C.  We next see him on June
21, 2020.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-16c">
<h3>Jonas-16C<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-16c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When Charlotte-2 comes to the Kahnwald house, Hannah and Jonas
bring her up to speed.  A group now starts to form.  Charlotte takes
them both to the bunker, where she and Peter have been collecting time
travel evidence.  It’s revealed that Peter and Tronte have been acting
on instructions of the elder Claudia, via the notebook.  Katharina
refuses to join the team.</p>
<p>Addressing the group, Jonas says that everything will happen the way
it always have, but that there <em>is</em> a loophole.  He intends to stop
Adam’s plans (but he hides the true identity of Adam).  He believes
that the elder Claudia tried to do this, but instead became what she
was trying to fight.  (In fact, Claudia has found the solution, and it
is <em>Jonas</em> who is acting to perpetuate the cycle.)</p>
<p>On June 25, Jonas goes to Martha’s room and puts the St. Christopher
pendant on her bed.  He has been carrying it with him since she gave
it to him in his youth.</p>
<p>Awakening on June 26, Jonas finds that his mother has taken the
machine and traveled somewhere (she is in 1954).  When Martha-3 later
comes to find Hannah, Jonas instead reveals himself to her.  When
Katharina later barges in, Martha reveals the existence of their
machine (that they got from Bartosz, via Noah).</p>
<p>On the day of the apocalypse, Jonas pleads with Martha to go with him
to safety, but Martha refuses, saying that they aren’t right together.
Instead, Jonas forces her to the bunker and locks her in there.</p>
<p>When Jonas returns to the Kahnwald house, he finds Katharina on her
way out with his cave exploration tools, intending to go and find
Mikkel.  She has left the machine behind, not knowing how to use it.
When lights begin flickering, Jonas understands that his younger self
has now opened the tunnel.</p>
<p>After Katharina has left, the younger Noah-2 arrives, bringing a note
from Martha.  Noah tasks him to take the machine to save the kids in
the Nielsen house.  He does this, bringing young Magnus, Franziska and
Bartosz with him to 1888, where he becomes Jonas-17C.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jonas-17c">
<h3>Jonas-17C<a class="headerlink" href="#jonas-17c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Jonas, Magnus, Franziska and Bartosz arrive in 1888.  They are out of
God particles, so they are stuck there for now.  At some point they
meet the elder and wealthy gentleman Tannhaus, who invests them in the
nascent Sic Mundus and gives them a place for experimenting.  Jonas,
of course, spent decades in the far future doing exactly this, but
this time he has no God particles!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Martha-4D arrives on September 21 that year.  She
brings with her an orb as well as a capsule of God particles.  Jonas,
not knowing about the split realities or the different worlds,
believes any version of Martha to be dead and so immediately mistrusts
her.</p>
<p>Two days later a big fight happens.  Bartosz accuses Jonas of being
fully aware that they would become stuck in 1888, and believes him
already to be inhabiting the malevolent Adam persona, instead of
trying to prevent it.  Jonas, in turn, believes he is being used by a
fraudulent Martha.</p>
<p>Later, Martha confides in Jonas that she did not write the letter he
has which is allegedly from her. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#letter" id="id1">1</a>  She then gives him a
capsule of God particles, claiming it is her last, although in reality
she has another.  As Jonas tries to activate the particles, Martha
sneaks off to her room where she travels to 2053.  The day after,
Jonas burns the letter, presumably having taken another step toward
becoming Adam, but he quickly finds another, which was placed there by
the middle-aged Martha-B.</p>
<p>In 1890, Jonas sustains an injury to his arm while experimenting.  Is
this how Adam got his disfigured face?  Later that year, Silja-3
arrives from 2053 and hooks up with Bartosz.  In 1904 they bring
Noah-1 into the world, and in 1910 Silja dies giving birth to
Agnes-1. Both the children are eventually indoctrinated into the Sic
Mundus cult by Jonas.</p>
<p>In 1911, Hannah-5 arrives with her daughter, and Jonas’ half-sister,
the younger Silja-1.  Jonas, who is now fully Adam, murders his mother
and takes Silja away to be sent to the postapocalyptic far future,
where she will eventually play the role needed to send younger Jonas-5
to 1921.</p>
<p>In 1920, the middle-aged Noah-3 returns from his mission in the far
future.  He believes that Jonas-9C abducted Charlotte, but Jonas-17C
tells him that he did not, and instead turns his suspicion toward the
elder Claudia.  With him he brings the notebook with the last pages
missing, as Jonas expected.  He gives Noah the mission to find them,
as they will lead both to Charlotte and to paradise.</p>
<p>On January 8, 1921, a photograph is taken of all members of Sic
Mundus.  In it, we can see Bartosz, Magnus, Franziska, Jonas, Agnes
and two different Noahs.</p>
<p>On June 24, 1921, Jonas-6 arrives from the postapocalyptic
future, as the elder Jonas certainly knew that he would.  The next day
he sends him on his way again, saying that he lived his entire life
trying to avoid this conversation, but that he now understands what he
must do.  He is sent to June 20, 2019 using the now fully functional
God particle vortex, ostensibly on a mission to prevent his father’s
suicide but really to cause it in the first place.</p>
<p>On June 27 Jonas sends the younger Noah-1 to 2020 to play the role
that he needs to play in the apocalypse.  At this point, the
middle-aged Noah finally confronts him about his lies and
manipulation, revealing to him the final pages of the notebook in the
process, including the identity of what Jonas believes to be the
origin of the cycle.  Noah points a gun at him but it fails to fire,
just like it did in 2023 when they were both younger.  At this point,
Agnes walks in and uses the same weapon to kill Noah.</p>
<p>Finally, Jonas again travels through time, to 2020 in order to kill
Martha in front of his younger self.</p>
