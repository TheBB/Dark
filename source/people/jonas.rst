Jonas Kahnwald
==============

Jonas is the son of :ref:`hannah` and Mikkel Nielsen.  He is the best
candidate to any sort of protagonist of *Dark*.  He begins his life in
the 2000s, being led to discover time travel after the suicide of his
father.  After the apocalypse of world A in 2020, his chronology
splits into three different lines.

Jonas\ :sub:`c` survives the apocalypse and grows to a middle-aged man
in post-apocalyptic Winden, trying to get time travel to work in the
destroyed nuclear plant, although the efforts are secretly sabotaged
by Claudia.  Upon finally returning to Winden he attempts to close the
passage.  Experiencing the apocalypse again, he escapes back to the
1890s together with a cadre of characters, where he begins forming the
nascent Sic Mundus and takes on the persona of Adam, aiming to end the
cycle by destroying the unborn nameless man.

Jonas\ :sub:`d` is rescued by Martha\ :sub:`b` and taken to world B,
where he sets into motion the necessary events to perpetuate the cycle
there.  In particular he sleeps with Martha, bringing the nameless man
into existence.  He is shot dead shortly thereafter by Martha.

Jonas\ :sub:`e` is rescued by Adam and taken to world B where he
intercepts the timeline of Martha, taking her to world Z where they
together successfully end the cycle.


Jonas\ :sub:`1`
---------------

On June 20, 2019, exactly one day before the opening of the passage,
Jonas is enjoying a nice day at the like together with Martha\
:sub:`1`, Magnus\ :sub:`1` and Bartosz\ :sub:`1`.  Bartosz tells a
story of a woman who drowned in the lake.  In fact, unbeknownst to
anyone, the dead body of Katharina is actually there.  In the sand,
Jonas finds a St. Christopher medal, where it was left after the
scuffle between Helene and Katharina.  Jonas must leave early, and he
leaves the medal behind.

Later that day, at Katharina’s birthday party, Jonas runs into Martha
who gives him the St. Christopher medal, now on a chain.  Martha is
acting very forward, because since the last time they met she ran into
Jonas\ :sub:`7`, believing him to be Jonas\ :sub:`1`.  They eventually
kiss and sleep together.

The next day, Jonas and his mother discover the suicide of Michael,
along with a suicide note which eventually passes to Ines, Jonas’
grandmother by adoption.  Over time, the relationship between Hannah
and Ines start deteriorating.  Jonas finds himself needing to take
time off school for therapy.  Preventing his father’s death is Jonas’
principal motivation for the first part of the story.

On November 4, his first day back in school, he goes to the caves
together with Martha, Magnus, Bartosz and Mikkel\ :sub:`1`.  They are
looking for Erik’s secret stash of drugs.  After this, Mikkel goes
missing, having been taken by Jonas\ :sub:`7` through the tunnel
to 1986.

The next day, Jonas discovers a map of the Winden caves hidden in his
late father’s studio.  On November 6 he enters the cave to explore,
but is unable to find the way.  That night, middle-aged Jonas\
:sub:`10c` sneaks into his bedroom to scribble a hint on the map.  The
next day he also meets Jonas\ :sub:`10c` at the graveyard, not knowing
who he is.  The elder Jonas says they don’t know each other, but that
Jonas’ father once saved his life (which he did, by committing
suicide).

Later that day, Jonas breaks a promise to Bartosz and instead of
joining him goes to see Martha’s theater practice.  He reveals to her
the fact about his absence from school, and they kiss again.  When he
comes home, he finds a package sent to him by Jonas\ :sub:`10c` with
cave exploration equipment and his father’s opened suicide note.  He
reads the note, which is addressed to him. On November 8, armed with
better tools and knowledge, he re-enters the cave and successfully
finds the tunnel, traveling to 1986 as Jonas\ :sub:`2`.


Jonas\ :sub:`2`
---------------

Jonas meets Hannah\ :sub:`1`, his own mother as a young girl and
spends the night in a watchtower.  The next day, Egon gives him a lift
to the hospital, where he intends to retrieve Mikkel\ :sub:`2`,
however Jonas\ :sub:`11c` (the same Jonas he met earlier in the
graveyard), having traveled to 1986 the day before Jonas\ :sub:`2`
did, intercepts him and explains that Mikkel must stay here in order
for Jonas to exist at all.  Later that day, he travels back to 2019 as
Jonas\ :sub:`3`.


Jonas\ :sub:`3`
---------------

Upon coming home, Jonas burns the suicide note from his father that
the elder Jonas had given him.  A few days later he rejects Martha’s
advances, knowing full well that she is his own aunt.  Martha, of
course, is confused because she received very strong hints from Jonas\
:sub:`7`, which the younger Jonas is unaware of.

On November 12, Jonas goes to Ines, and she tells him that she knew
that Mikkel\ :sub:`2` came from the future.  She gives him the suicide
note.  This time Jonas does not destroy it.  He will carry it with him
for decades in post-apocalyptic Winden before giving it to his younger
self.  Later that day, he again travels through the tunnel to 1986,
becoming Jonas\ :sub:`4`.


Jonas\ :sub:`4`
---------------

After a brief and cryptic conversation with young Charlotte\ :sub:`2`,
Jonas makes his way to Mikkel\ :sub:`2`’s bed in the hospital, but is
abducted by Noah and Helge\ :sub:`3`.  They take him to the bunker,
where the elder Jonas\ :sub:`13c` explains who he really is, and why
he cannot let the younger Jonas out.

When Jonas\ :sub:`13c` later closes the tunnel using the machine, a
wormhole appears in the bunker, allowing Helge\ :sub:`1` to travel
from 1953 to 1986, and for Jonas to travel to 2052 as Jonas\ :sub:`5`.


Jonas\ :sub:`5`
---------------

Upon arrival in postapocalyptic Winden, he is promptly arrested by
Silja\ :sub:`3`, Elisabeth\ :sub:`1` and their paramilitary group.
Over the next months, he takes to live in his old home, the Kahnwald
house, where he notes the presence of a St. Christopher medal exactly
like he has.

Most of his time is spent listening to the old audio tapes left behind
by the elder Claudia, who spent many years doing research in the
bunker.  Silja and Elisabeth want to prevent him from accessing the
old power plant ruins, but eventually Jonas sneaks in anyway and finds
a mass of God particles there.

On an excursion to get fuel for a generator, he is arrested and hanged
by Elisabeth, but is also saved by at the last minute.  This gives him
a bad and very visible scar around his neck.

Later on, Silja lets him go free.  He takes her to the God particle
mas and uses it to travel from 2053 to 1921, becoming Jonas\ :sub:`6`.



Jonas\ :sub:`6`
---------------

Jonas arrives in 1921 on June 24.  At the inn, he meets the young
siblings Agnes\ :sub:`1` and Noah\ :sub:`1`.  Attempting to enter the
tunnel, Jonas finds it closed, and Noah explains that it will not open
for another 32 years (on June 21, 1953).  He is then taken to the Sic
Mundus headquarters, meeting again the elder Noah who abducted him
earlier.

Adam then sends Jonas to June 20, 2019, the same day the slightly
younger Jonas\ :sub:`1` spent at the lake.  This is the first time we
see a time travel interval that is not a multiple of 33 years.  Young
Jonas believes he can prevent his father’s suicide, and Adam is all
too happy to let him believe it, knowing instead that he will cause in
the first place.


Jonas\ :sub:`7`
---------------

Jonas goes to the lake to talk to Martha, just after his younger self
Jonas\ :sub:`1` left.  This time he acts very romantically, saying
they are indeed perfect for each other (he must have regretted the
earlier confrontation) and they kiss.

Later that day, he makes his way to the Kahnwald house while everyone
else is at Katharina’s birthday party.  He tries to convince his
father not to commit suicide, but all he really does is ensure that it
happens.  He even shows him the suicide note, allowing his father to
read what it is he must write.

The elderly Claudia appears and reveals Adam’s betrayal, and explains
that, nevertheless, the older Mikkel\ :sub:`2` must die, and Jonas\
:sub:`7` must also engineer the disappearance of younger Mikkel\
:sub:`2` several months later.

We next see Jonas in 1987 as Jonas\ :sub:`8`, acting as the agent of
elderly Claudia.  Between now and then he has spent about a full year
of personal time under her tutalage.  It seems that, during this time,
his motivation is transfered from his father to saving Martha from the
impending apocalypse.


Jonas\ :sub:`8`
---------------

On June 26, 1987, Jonas finds middle-aged Claudia\ :sub:`3` devastated
in her own kitchen after the death of her father Egon.  He has been
tasked by the elderly Claudia to influence her, indicating that Egon’s
death may be prevented.

They go to the caves, where Jonas collects God particle from the
barrels and activates the machine (which he got from Claudia),
reopening the tunnel in the process.  They both travel to 2020.


Jonas\ :sub:`9`
---------------

On the day of the apocalypse in world A, Jonas\ :sub:`9` and Claudia\
:sub:`4` arrive.  Jonas instructs Claudia to find Regina and take
shelter in the bunker.  Jonas himself makes his way to the Kahnwald
house, where he finds Martha\ :sub:`3`.  There, they are interrupted
by the arrival of Adam, who shoots and kills Martha.

At this point, the apocalypse happens, allowing a splitting of Jonas’
timeline.  It’s important to note that none of the three versions of
Jonas are aware of the others.

- In one case, Jonas simply makes his way to the basement of the house
  and survives the apocalypse.  He lives out the rest of his youth and
  early adulthood in postapocalyptic Winden as Jonas\ :sub:`9c`.  This
  is the Jonas that eventually becomes Adam.  At this point his
  motivation is primarily driven by trying to prevent Martha’s death
  at the hands of his elderly self.

- In another case, Jonas is rescued by Martha from world B and taken
  there, becoming Jonas\ :sub:`9d`.  He is responsible for key events
  in the perpetuation of the cycle in that world, but does not live
  long.

- In the third case, Jonas is rescued by *another* version of Adam,
  taken to the apocalypse of world B as Jonas\ :sub:`9e` where he
  teams up with a version of Martha.  The two then finally end the
  cycle.


Jonas\ :sub:`9c`
----------------

On September 24, 2020, Jonas\ :sub:`9c` runs into Claudia\ :sub:`4`
again, this time by the God particle mass in the power plant.  It’s
revealed that the machine that brought them there from the 80s was
broken in the apocalypse.

The next time we see Jonas, in 2023, he is working together with
Claudia to try to get the God particle mass to function correctly.
Some kind of shield appears to be preventing their work.  Jonas
loses heart and goes to the Kahnwald house to commit suicide in the
same place where his father once did.  He is interrupted by Noah\
:sub:`2`, who demonstrates to Jonas how truly futile it is to try to
change events.  Noah appears to be of the opinion that they will be
friends before Jonas will betray him.  (Although it is really the
elderly Adam who will be perpetrating the betrayal.)

The group of four then forms: Jonas, Noah, Elisabeth and Claudia.  For
the next decades, they continue experimenting with the God particle
without success.  A breakthrough does not happen until 2040, when they
succeed in penetrating the shield, however time travel is still far
from possible. Noah harbors misgivings about Claudia’s true
motivations (which is correct, Claudia is sabotaging the experiments),
and he abandons the work in 2041 after his daughter is abducted,
believing this to be Jonas’ betrayal.

In 2052, having finally stabilized the God particle, Claudia sends
Jonas back to 2019.  He brings with him the broken time machine,
intending for Tannhaus to repair it, and the book about time travel.
His instructions are to close the tunnel and destroy the knot, and she
implores him not to lose hope (although he will).


Jonas\ :sub:`10c`
-----------------

Jonas arrives in 2019 on November 5, and takes a room at the hotel
where he decorates the walls with time travel effects.  His first acts
are to help his younger self explore the cave, by writing a hint on
his map and later sending him a box of cave exploration equipment.
This is also when he gives away his father’s suicide note for the last
time.  Younger Jonas will burn it.

After the conversation at the graveyard with Jonas\ :sub:`1`, he goes
through the tunnel to 1986, becoming Jonas\ :sub:`11c`.


Jonas\ :sub:`11c`
-----------------

On November 7, Jonas first meets the elder Tannhaus.  He spends
several days in 1986, meeting Tannhaus on and off.  He eventually
shows him the broken time machine, and although the master is at first
reluctant to help, he shows him the new machine that he has been
working on.


Jonas\ :sub:`12c`
-----------------

At some point, Jonas travels back to 2019 to collect God particles
from the barrels in the truck.  He then promptly returns to 1986.


Jonas\ :sub:`13c`
-----------------

On November 12, Jonas takes the new machine with him to the tunnel,
but not before stopping by the bunker to reveal his true identity to
the younger Jonas\ :sub:`4` who is now trapped there.  He leaves him
behind, knowing that a wormhole will soon let him travel to 2052.

When he activates the machine in the tunnel, he also travels back to
2019 in the process, becoming Jonas\ :sub:`14c`.  We next see him on
June 21, 2020.


Jonas\ :sub:`14c`
-----------------

On June 21, 2020, Jonas reveals himself and his true identity to his
mother Hannah\ :sub:`1`.  He says that he tried to destroy the tunnel
but only managed to close it.  The next day, he shows her the machine
and brings her with him to 1987.


Jonas\ :sub:`15c`
-----------------

On a brief time travel trip to 1987, Jonas shows Hannah the truth of
her husband.  They come straight back.


Jonas\ :sub:`16c`
-----------------

When Charlotte\ :sub:`2` comes to the Kahnwald house, Hannah and Jonas
bring her up to speed.  A group now starts to form.  Charlotte takes
them both to the bunker, where she and Peter have been collecting time
travel evidence.  It’s revealed that Peter and Tronte have been acting
on instructions of the elder Claudia, via the notebook.  Katharina
refuses to join the team.

Addressing the group, Jonas says that everything will happen the way
it always have, but that there *is* a loophole.  He intends to stop
Adam’s plans (but he hides the true identity of Adam).  He believes
that the elder Claudia tried to do this, but instead became what she
was trying to fight.  (In fact, Claudia has found the solution, and it
is *Jonas* who is acting to perpetuate the cycle.)

On June 25, Jonas goes to Martha’s room and puts the St. Christopher
pendant on her bed.  He has been carrying it with him since she gave
it to him in his youth.

Awakening on June 26, Jonas finds that his mother has taken the
machine and traveled somewhere (she is in 1954).  When Martha\
:sub:`3` later comes to find Hannah, Jonas instead reveals himself to
her.  When Katharina later barges in, Martha reveals the existence of
their machine (that they got from Bartosz, via Noah).

On the day of the apocalypse, Jonas pleads with Martha to go with him
to safety, but Martha refuses, saying that they aren’t right together.
Instead, Jonas forces her to the bunker and locks her in there.

When Jonas returns to the Kahnwald house, he finds Katharina on her
way out with his cave exploration tools, intending to go and find
Mikkel.  She has left the machine behind, not knowing how to use it.
When lights begin flickering, Jonas understands that his younger self
has now opened the tunnel.

After Katharina has left, the younger Noah\ :sub:`2` arrives, bringing
a note from Martha.  Noah tasks him to take the machine to save the
kids in the Nielsen house.  He does this, bringing young Magnus,
Franziska and Bartosz with him to 1888, where he becomes Jonas\
:sub:`17c`.
