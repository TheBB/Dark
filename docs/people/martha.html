<span id="martha"></span><h1>Martha Nielsen<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-nielsen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Martha Nielsen is the daughter of Ulrich and Katharina Nielsen.  In
world A she serves as the primary love interest of <a class="reference internal" href="jonas.html#jonas"><span class="std std-ref">Jonas Kahnwald</span></a>, with
limited impact on the actual time travel plot until she dies in the
apocalypse of that world.</p>
<p>The various versions of Martha in world B serve a key role in the
perpetuation of the cycle, and the resolution thereof.  She is
launched on her path in November of 2019 by the arrival of Jonas-9D
from world A.  She sleeps with him and thereby conceives the nameless
man.  After Jonas is shot dead by her elder self, she teams up with
Bartosz-B to try to stop the apocalypse, at which point her chronology
splits into three different lines.</p>
<p>Martha-C is sent to world A to rescue Jonas from the
apocalypse, but is thereafter interrupted by Bartosz<sub>b</sub>, and
they travel back to the Erit Lux headquarters.  She is then
manipulated into the role of Eva by her elder self in order to save
the life of her child.</p>
<p>Martha-D is also sent to world A to rescue Jonas, but is <em>not</em>
interrupted by Bartosz.  She then travels to 1888 in world A to give
the stranded Jonas-17C the God particles he needs to build his
time travel device.  After that she travels to 2053, where she is
taken and eventually killed by Sic Mundus.</p>
<p>Martha-E is intercepted by Jonas-9E before even being sent to world A.
Together they go to world Z where they successfully end the cycle.</p>
<div class="section" id="martha-b">
<span id="marthb"></span><h2>Martha-B<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-b" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The chronology of the character Martha<sub>b</sub> constitutes
everything happening to Martha from world B from the beginning of the
story up until the apocalypse in world A.</p>
<div class="section" id="martha-1b">
<h3>Martha-1B<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-1b" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We first see Martha-1B as she awakes on November 4, 2019 in
the Kahnwald house of world B.  At school that day, she is approached
by Jonas-9D, who has just been rescued from the apocalypse in
world A by her future self, but she doesn’t recognize him.</p>
<p>Later, under the bridge, Martha is again approached by Jonas before he
is chased away by her friends Magnus-1B, Bartosz-1B,
Franziska-1B and Killian-1B.  In the forest they get
scared and run away to the bunker where a wormhole develops.  The dead
body of Mads drops.</p>
<p>The next day, Jonas finally gains her attention by listing events from
her life that he couldn’t possibly know.  Intrigued, Martha follows
him through the tunnel to 2052, as Martha-2B.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="martha-2b">
<h3>Martha-2B<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-2b" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In post-apocalyptic Winden version B, Martha and Jonas are instructed
by middle-aged Martha-B that they must prevent the opening of
the barrels to avoid the apocalypse.  They then return to 2019,
becoming Martha-3B.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="martha-3b">
<h3>Martha-3B<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-3b" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On the night of November 6, Martha-3B sleeps with Jonas-11D.  She
becomes pregnant with the nameless man.</p>
<p>The next day, which is the day before the apocalypse, Martha and Jonas
break into the power plant.  When crossing the fence, Martha receives
a scratch under her eye: exactly the same scratch that he saw earlier
when rescued by the slightly older Martha in his own world.  Jonas
then realises he is not actually saving anyone, merely perpetuating
the cycle.</p>
<p>Together they go to the Erit Lux headquarters to confront Eva.  In
walks Martha-4C who shoots and kills Jonas.  Before he dies, he gives
her his St. Christopher pendant. Devastated, Martha-3B makes her way
out and recruits the help of Bartosz-1B to try to prevent the
apocalypse.  However before that happens, they are interrupted by
middle-aged Magnus and Franziska from world B.  They have an orb that
they give her.  At this point, Martha’s timeline splits in three:
<a class="reference internal" href="#marthac"><span class="std std-ref">Martha-C</span></a> (who becomes Eva), <a class="reference internal" href="#marthad"><span class="std std-ref">Martha-D</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#marthae"><span class="std std-ref">Martha-E</span></a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="martha-c">
<span id="marthac"></span><h2>Martha-C<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Martha-C is the version of Martha that eventually becomes the Eva
persona, mirroring that of Jonas-C, who becomes Adam.</p>
<p>Like her alternate self Martha-D, Martha-C is sent by the middle-aged
Magnus and Franziska to the apocalypse of world A to save the younger
Jonas.  Before she is able to do so, Martha-D is interrupted by
Bartosz-B, who is acting on orders of her elder self (Eva).  She is
spirited away from the apocalypse to the Erit Lux headquarters
of 2052.  There, she is taken under the protective wings of her elder
selves and indoctrinated into the Eva persona.</p>
<div class="section" id="martha-4c">
<h3>Martha-4C<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-4c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Upon arriving in the Erit Lux headquarters of 2052, the elder Martha
(as Eva) gives her a second scar, identifying her permanently as the
Eva personality.  She then pens the letter to Jonas, which the
middle-aged Martha-C takes to Jonas in the 1890s of world A.  The
letter will eventually end up in the hands of middle-aged Jonas-16C
during the apocalypse, and is intended to ensure that this Jonas
chooses to save Bartosz, Magnus and Franziska at the time of the
apocalypse, setting him on the path to becoming Adam.</p>
<p>Later she travels to 2019 as Martha-5C.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="martha-5c">
<h3>Martha-5C<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-5c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After arriving at the Erit Lux headquarters in 2019, Martha Later she
shoots and kills Jonas-11D in front of her younger Martha-3B self.
She then takes shelter from the impending apocalypse and makes her
life in post-apocalyptic world B.  Shortly thereafter we may presume
that the nameless man is born.  We see her next in the far future as
Martha-2B and Jonas comes to visit.</p>
<p>Slightly later, she has made her way to the future headquarters of
Erit Lux, where she takes the letter her younger self Martha-4C and
travels to 1888 of world A as Martha-6C.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="martha-6c">
<h3>Martha-6C<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-6c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Martha leaves the letter on Jonas’ nightstand and travels back to
world A as Martha-7C.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="martha-7c">
<h3>Martha-7C<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-7c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It’s unclear exactly what she does next and in what order, but as
Martha ages and begins to fully inhabit the persona of Eva, she takes
control of Erit Lux and their machinations.  She orchestrates the
events needed to set her younger self on the path of Eva, and various
things needed to perpetuate the cycle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="martha-d">
<span id="marthad"></span><h2>Martha-D<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-d" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Martha-D is the version of Martha that successfully saves the younger
Jonas-D from the apocalypse of world A, having not been interrupted by
Bartosz-B.  She then brings him to world B where he does what is
necessary to set her slightly younger self on her path.  After that,
she travels to the 1888 of world A to bring the nascent Sic Mundus the
material they need to begin working on time travel.  She then travels
to the far future of world B where she is murdered, along with her
unborn child.</p>
<div class="section" id="martha-4d">
<h3>Martha-4D<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-4d" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Having successfully saved Jonas-9D and brought him to world B, Martha
then travels to September 21, 1888 in world A.  There, she finds the
elder Jonas-17C, who does not remember her.  None of them understand
why that is.  Jonas has a letter that he believes was written by her,
but she doesn’t understand that either (it was written by another
version of herself).</p>
<p>Two days after arriving in this timeline, Martha gives Jonas a capsule
of God particles from her orb, lying to him that this is her last
remaining fuel.  Later she travels from 1888 to 2053 as Martha-5D.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="martha-5d">
<h3>Martha-5D<a class="headerlink" href="#martha-5d" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Upon arriving in 2053, as instructed by Magnus and Franziska, she
requests from the elder Jonas-19C, who has now fully become Adam,
information about where the origin of the loop is and how to destroy
it.  Jonas has now convinced himself that the origin is her unborn
child, so he has Silja arrest her.  Later she is forced to undress so
that Silja can dress appropriately as a woman of the 19th century, as
she is sent back to give birth to Agnes and Noah.  Martha is then
forced into the swirling vortex of God particles and killed.</p>
